## About me:

I'm studying Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park.
I plan to graduate in 2022.

I love Python and open-sourcing.

In high school, I competed in Botball, an international fully-autonomous
robotics competition. My team got 10th place at the global tournament. Our
code can be found [here](https://github.com/rockvillerobotics/Incredibots2018).

Now, my younger brother is on the team, and I help mentor the group. In 2019,
they went on to get 5th place in the world. Their code can be found
[here](https://github.com/rockvillerobotics/Incredibots2019).

My love of robotics inspired me to become a Laboratory Teaching Fellow for an
introductory robotics course, meaning I get to help lay the groundwork for the
new technologies students will be using by ensuring the libraries and vision
systems that they use work as intended. Some of my work can be found at the
[team GitHub](https://github.com/umdenes100).
